                              FREEWARE ITEMS
                              ==============

Freeware items are Free! All I ask is that you send me a blank disk and P&H
or send enough money to cover a disk and postage. I'll trust you; $6 to $7
should hopefully cover the costs, but I haven't asked the post office what
its latest rates are.

#01-001       THE SOFTWARE EXPERIENCE #1    Release 1.1
              This is an incredible graphics demo for the Apple IIgs with a
              state of the art 3-D rotating object, which was actually drawn on
              a $125,000 computer!

#01-001-S     THE SOFTWARE EXPERIENCE #1 SOURCE CODE Release 1.1
              Source code for The Software Experience #1. All relevant code is
              included, but some data files are missing, so don't expect to
              be able to make a working copy of TSE #1. This code is released
              mainly as a learning experience. (The Learning Experience #1 ???)

#01-002       Z3D DEMONSTRATION #1
              The first demonstration of the Z3D realtime 3D animation system.
              Z3D sports pseudo-hidden line removal and high speed animation.

#01-003       Z3D DEMONSTRATION #2
              The second demonstration of the Z3D realtime 3D animation system.
              Z3D now supports perspective objects and colored lines.

#01-004       THE EXPERIENCE #2
              The second in the software experience demos. This demo includes
              an original soundtrack and a high-tech circular VU meter.

#01-005       MAXUS DEMO I
              The first demo I wrote to help develop a game for the IIgs.
              This demo contains several types of fades and an interrupt-
              driven starfield.

#01-006       MAXUS DEMO II
              This demo is a continuation of the first demo, but resembles a
              game in many respects. A game screen was developed, a mouse-
              operated turret gun and many other features. If you'd like to
              see this eventually turned into a game, then let me know.


                              SHAREWARE ITEMS
                              ===============

Shareware items are programs which may copied freely, but if you find yourself
using the program, you are encouraged to mail a shareware fee of $10 to $20,
otherwise destroy your copy. Shareware programs will be supported minimally.
Shareware fees are listed under the order #.

#02-001       ZAVTRA MACRO UTILITY DISK    Release 1.2
  $15         This disk contains hundreds of APW/ORCA style macros for the
              Apple IIgs. These macros allow for a Pascal-like interface to the
              Apple IIgs tools, and there are numerous other powerful utility
              macros. Also included are text files with file type information
              and page $E1 vector locations!

#02-002       Z-LAUNCH   Pre-Release 0.30
  $20         Z-Launch is a powerful program launcher for the Apple IIgs which
              uses a custom graphical user interface. Z-Launch incorporates
              both a file selection utility and a list of commonly used 
              applications. Computer defaults and parameters can even be
              set up for different applicatins such as Transwarp/system speed,
              etc...THIS IS STILL PRE-RELEASE SO MANY MAJOR FEATURES ARE NOT
              IMPLEMENTED, but if you pay the $20 shareware fee now, I will 
              send you release 1.0 to you free upon completion. I make NO
              guarantees that it will ever be finished and I don't expect anyone
              to send shareware fees for Pre-Release programs anyways.

#02-003       ZPACK   Release 2.0
  $10         ZPACK is toolset and utility program for packing and unpacking
              various types of file formats, all based on the ZPACK algorithm.
              Includes ZPack Master, a picture converter application. Toolset
              functions are also included for other compression formates such
              as Apple Preferred picture compression.

                              SOUNDSMITH SONGS
                              ================

These are songs which I've arranged for SoundSmith, a shareware product by
Huibert Aalbers. These songs are the same as Freeware items.
