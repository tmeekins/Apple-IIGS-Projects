MaXUS Demo I
by Tim Meekins

In December 1989 and Janary 1990, I set out to begin the development of an
arcade game for the IIgs. Not really knowing what sort of game to write, I
made it a goal to simply develop interesting screen effects and allow a
game to slowly evolve throughout the process. As of this date (March 1991)
I still have not written this game, but I came across some of the earlier
demos I wrote experimenting with the game. So, I've decided to release them
to you all. Here is the first MaXUS demo which was written in January 1990.
This was my first attempt ever at doing high quality graphics on the IIgs.
