MaXUS Demo II
by Tim Meekins

In December 1989, I began developing the rudiments of a game. My main goal
was to develop programming techniques; finishing the game was a distant
second goal. By January 1990, I had finished the MaXUS Demo I. Although
it didn;t resemble a game in anyway, it was a good stepping stone for
future projects.

After the first demo was completed, I spent the next four months developing
it into a foundation of a game. The second demo was completed in May 1990.
This demos sports many features from the first demo such as a pure smooth 
fade and an interrupt driven star field. New features included a realtime
clock, circular fade-in, and an interrupt-driven mouse-controlled turret.

By May 1990, all development stopped. I don't even know why. It is now
March 1991 and I'm looking at the demos again and they hold much promise.
So, if anyone else sees much potential in this project and has ideas for
a game plot, please send me your suggestions. Maybe I'll get back on this
project and actually write that promised game
