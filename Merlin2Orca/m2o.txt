-------------------

'm2o' can be run from any standard shell on the Apple IIgs including
GNO/ME(*) and Orca.

it is invoked by typing its filename, 'm2o' followed by the Merlin source
code file to convert (make sure you include the '.s') and then followed by
the name you wish to convert it to. The syntax is as follow:

    m2o <infile> [<outfile>]

where <infile> is the Merlin file to convert and <outfile> is the file to
be created by 'm2o.' If <outfile> is not specified, the generated source code
is sent to standard out. For example, to view Merlin source under GNO, try
the following command 'm2o foo.s | more'

In a nutshell, trying to use Merlin source files in the Orca/M assembler can
be quite a pain. 'm2o' tries to ease the porting the process by converting
as much of the file as possible to a format that Orca/M should like. The
translations are usually never perfect, but once running a file through
'm2o,' the work left to the programmer is minimal. About the only hassle left
that 'm2o' leaves "as an exercise for the programmer" is converting macros.
I was seriously designing support for macro conversion and loop expansion
in 'm2o,' but this would require extensive programming on my behalf, in fact,
I would need to write parse code almost as complex as that already used by
Merlin. The idea of 'm2o' was to convert the code with the simplest code
possible that could be quickly modified as needed. In fact, the source code
is included. If you should enhance 'm2o' in a positive manner, or need some
changes done (don't even ask for macros yet), be sure to send me a note.

Until later.....and happy hacking!
