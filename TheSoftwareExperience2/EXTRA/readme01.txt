The Software Experience #2
Pre-Release 0.01

==========================================================================

OK, for everyone who requested it, here is a very pre-release copy of TSE #2.
This pre-release shows off both my fast-boot program, intro graphics, and
custom music sequencing software. If you have any comments on the current
progress, please let me know!! This demo is being written for the Apple II
community.

There are still some problems with the scrolling text, but I'm aware of them
and they WILL be fixed, I just added the scrolling text about 2 hours ago
so there would be something to read while listening to T&F in D Minor.

Current plans for the future of TSE #2:

The screen with scrolling text will be the intro screen. I also plan an
adding a kaleidascope thingy here and maybe a prgram title across the top.

A user presses key/mouse button to continue to the main demo, which will be
an interactive 3-D demo kind of like Modulae, but with manu differences...
(Hey, I'm one guy, and FTA has fleet of programmers, what do expect from me?)
