Z3D Demonstration #2
by Tim Meekins
March 24, 1991

This is the second in a series of programs demostrating the Z3D
3-Dimensional graphics system.

NOTICE: For best results, use a 7 MHz Transwarp GS or 8 MHz Zip Chip.

Z3D now uses the ZPack toolset. This distribution includes the file TOOL230
which should be copied to the */SYSTEM/TOOLS/ directory.

Credits: The line drawing code was borrowed without permission from the
         Modulae demo by FTA. I DID make several mods of my own to it, though.
         If you think I can't write my own code, then look at Nibble Feb '88.

This version has the following features:
  o High Speed math
  o Wireframe rendering
  o Optional BackFace rejection
  o Concurrent Process animation synchronization using semaphores
  o Multiple object support
  o Perspective viewport projection
  o Viewport transformations
  o Pseudo-clipping.
  o Color line drawing

Soon to come:
  o Real clipping
  o Solid rendering ( vs. wireframe)
  o Movable eye
  o Increased speed in math routines
  o Mini flight simulator
  o Mini tank battle
  o Binary Space Partitioning
  o More interesting objects than the cube
  o Light sources
  o Shadowing (not realtime?)
