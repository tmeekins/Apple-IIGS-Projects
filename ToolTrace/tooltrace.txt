Tool Tracer 1.0
Copyright 1992 by Tim Meekins

Tool Tracer is a nifty little CDA which flashes the border red whenever
a specified tool had been accessed. For example, let's say you need to
trace BeginUpdate calls. Enter the control panerl, select System Tool
trace and enter the tool number for BeginUpdate, $1E0E.

That's all there is to it. Tool Tracer is extremely simple to use and
has not caused any observable trouble to the system. Tool Tracer does
incur the slightest slowdown during tool calls ONLY IF A TRACE IS
ACTIVATED. As long as no calls are being traced, Tool Tracer is
invisible to the system.

Coming soon I'll add the ability to trace user tool calls, GS/OS, and
any $5C-style vector in memory.
